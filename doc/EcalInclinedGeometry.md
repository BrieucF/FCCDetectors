Description of the ECAL geometry
--

Highly granular noble liquid calorimeter is composed of absorber plates (lead) inclined with respect to the radial direction. The active material between the plates is liquid argon (LAr). Readout is done with printed circuit board (PCB). The readout planes are placed in between the absorber plates. The PCB readout enables longitudinal segmentation.

First layer - so called strip layer.
